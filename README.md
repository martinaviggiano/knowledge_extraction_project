# knowledge_extraction_project

This project is based on the analysis of textual data of United States case law dataset provided by [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/bulk/download/). 

The object is to study relevant terms within the text of court decisions and to measure frequency and correlation between words.

## Note

The work has been split in 4 pages:

- *01_Pre_processing* in which we imported and cleaned data;
- *02_Term_frequency* in which we studied term frequecies;
- *03_Word2Vec_PMI* in which we computed cosine similarity and studied co-occurrences;
- *04_Results* in which we can test models defined in the previous steps.
