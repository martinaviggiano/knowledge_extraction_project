# knowledge_extraction_project

This project presents an analysis of textual data of United States case law dataset provided by [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/bulk/download/). 
The object is to study relevant terms within the text of court decisions and to measure frequency and correlation between words.

## Note

The work has been split in 3 pages:

1. *01_Cleaning* in which we imported and cleaned data;
2. *02_Steps* in which we studied term frequecies;
3. *03_Grams_PMI* in which we computed cosine similarity.
